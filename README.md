# Predicts-The-Risk-of-TB-Diabetes
This project uses a Random Forest model and is built with Python (Flask). We created a synthetic dataset that simulates real-world health data including age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose level, HbA1c, and lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol, diabetes, and TB history.
